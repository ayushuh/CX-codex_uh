                    <h3>Ultrahuman M1 Overview</h3>
                    <p>The Ultrahuman M1 is a wearable glucose monitoring system designed to help users optimize their metabolic health. It works by continuously measuring glucose levels from the interstitial fluid using a CGM sensor.</p>

                    <h4>How It Works</h4>
                    <p>The device uses a tiny filament inserted just under the skin (painlessly, for most people). It tracks your glucose levels 24/7, updating every few minutes. You scan the sensor with your phone to retrieve the data.</p>

                    <p>sensor_scan_not_working Sensor Sensor fails to successfully scan and enter the 60 min warm up stage This is a possible NFC not working situation. Three troubleshooting techniques we go for - a) Restarting the phone b) Uninstalling and reinstalling the app c) Logging out and logging in If the user is on an iPhone, simply asking them the iPhone works. If the NFC issue persists, request the user to check with family/friends for an NFC enabled phone. The start once they successfully activate their sensor worries there. Also, the sensor stores data for if there's anyone's phone that they could use once every 7 hours, that would do it. The user be logged in from multiple devices using the same details, so they can monitor from their phone make all the necessary inputs and just use the friends/family phone for scanning. Some quirky pointers - If the user is using a Samsung phone, ask them to off their case and use the back side of their phone scan the sensor. Sometimes the case's thickness the NFC from working properly. There seems to be some problem with OnePlus phone's NFC. Just confirm the phone model or proceeding with troubleshooting problems.</p>
                    <p>sensor_invalid_readings Sensor Sensor is reporting invalid readings (≤40 or ≥500) for over 6-8 hours. Readings less than 40 and higher than 500 considered invalid readings. Check this data on Stints place of the Ops Dash. If invalid readings persist for over 6 hours, replace. If the user is in the first 24 hours, we ask them for the first 24 hour window.</p>
                    <p>sensor_invalid_reading_midway Sensor Cyborgs graph isn't updating upon scanning/stuck at the same value Check 'CGM Stints/Lifetime Data' on the ops dashboard. Look for readings below 40 or above If it's Day 1 on the sensor, let the user know sensor takes 24 hours to calibrate. If it's past Day 1 and the sensor has been replaced invalid readings for over 6-8 hours, process a replacement.</p>

                    <p>The charger is working fine for the user, but the ring is not detecting the charge and picking up battery.</p>

                    <h4>Resolution</h4>
                    <p>Step 1: Ring charger test</p>
                    <p>We check the Fit of the ring to ensure that the sensors are oriented properly</p>
                    <p>Macro: [#Ring_charger_test]</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Could you please confirm the type of adapter that you are using with the charging dock (Brand name and whether it is a normal or fast charger)? The adapter should be within 20 watts and less than 2 AMPS. Please attach images of the adapter for reference.</li>
                        <li>Have you tested the charging cable with other devices to confirm its functionality? If possible, try using a different cable to rule out cable issues.</li>
                        <li>When you switch on the charging dock without placing the ring on it, does the LED light turn purple?</li>
                        <li>When you place the ring on the charging dock, does the LED light on the dock change to a breathing white light? If not, please flip the ring and observe the LED colour.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This information will help us narrow down the potential causes of the charging issue and provide more targeted solutions.</p>
                    <p>Step 2: If the charger is deemed to be faulty we replace the charger</p>
                    <p>If the charger is working fine, we move ahead with the next steps</p>
                    <p>Step 3: Check for Damage on the Ring's Hardware</p>
                    <p>If the charger is confirmed to be working fine, we ask the user to check for any visible damage on the ring around its sensors and request relevant images for further assessment.</p>
                    <p>Step 4:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A: In case of observed hardware damage, replace the ring under hardware damage reasoning.</li>
                        <li>B: In case there are no observed damages, replace the ring under battery failure reasoning.</li>

                    <p>Things to be reviewed: Firmware version, battery state graph (dissipation Rate), CDT (High/Low), reset history</p>
                    <p>Step 2: Upgrade Firmware (to the latest firmware)</p>
                    <p>Macro: [#Pushto_Zephyr]</p>
                    <p>I have pushed the latest firmware to your ring. Please quit the app completely, and reopen the app in a while. If you don't see the Firmware Update pop-up, it should appear within the next few hours (If it doesn't, please head to ring battery view > scroll down > "check for firmware update"). Once it does, follow the prompts and update your firmware. Once your firmware has been updated, please observe for a while. You shouldn't face these issues anymore :)</p>

                    <p>Step 3: Factory reset</p>
                    <p>Macro: Zephyr_New_FR</p>
                    <p>Please go ahead and factory reset your ring here (Ring battery view > scroll down > factory reset > follow the prompts). Once this is done, keep the ring on the charger and you will notice a green LED light when the ring is placed on the charger. At this point, the ring will disconnect from the phone which is expected behaviour so don't worry! Once you see the green light, remove the ring from the charger and connect the ring.</p>
                    <p>You can click here and view the process to factory reset the ring.</p>
                    <p>After this reset, we need to enable Chill mode.</p>
                    <p>Step 4: Enable "Chill mode" and keep it on for at least 48 hours</p>
                    <p>Macro: chill_mode_enable</p>
                    <p>To enable Chill Mode for your ring, please follow the steps below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click on the ring icon on the top right of the ring homepage</li>
                        <li>Click on Choose a Battery Usage Mode</li>
                        <li>Toggle Chill mode</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After this, the user needs to observe the battery drain from 100% to 10%, while keeping chill mode enabled - and let us know when down to 10%. Then we check the rate of drain and for how many days the battery lasted.</p>
                    <p>Step 5: In case of a high BDR post the above steps, we replace the ring.</p>
                    <p>Battery Health Assessment</p>
                    <p>All users must have 48 hours of Chill Mode data for accurate assessment (the dashboard shows "Calibrating" status until sufficient data collected)</p>
                    <p>Battery health indicators:</p>
                    <p>BDR (Battery Dissipation Rate) % drain per hour</p>
                    <p>Good BDR: ≤1.0 (equals ≥4 days)</p>
                    <p>Optimal BDR: ≤0.5 (equals ≥8 days)</p>
                    <p>Replacement threshold: any user that has ≤4 days battery life</p>
                    <p>(48 hours BDR battery life] after using Chill Mode for at least 48 hours warrants a replacement.</p>

                    <p>If even after all these steps, if the issue still persists we replace the ring.</p>

                    <h3>Ring not Connecting/Advertising</h3>
                    <h4>Case Identifier</h4>
                    <p>The user is trying to pair their ring: The ring is experiencing an issue with advertising and pairing with the app.</p>

                    <h4>Resolution</h4>
                    <p>Step 1:</p>
                    <p>Macro Name: #ConnectionTS1</p>
                    <p>Let's rule out the basics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turn Off Power Saver Mode on Your Phone: Low battery (below 20%) can degrade Bluetooth performance. Charge your phone to maintain a stable connection.</li>
                        <li>Disconnect Unused Bluetooth Devices: Having too many connected devices can block new connections. Disconnect unused devices from your phone's Bluetooth settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then, continue troubleshooting with these:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Switch Off Wi-Fi Temporarily: Wi-Fi can occasionally interfere with Bluetooth. Turn it off briefly to improve connectivity.</li>
                        <li>Toggle Bluetooth Off/On: Turn Bluetooth off, wait a few seconds, then turn it back on to refresh the connection.</li>
                        <li>Complete a Bluetooth Reset: Keep the Ring on the charger → Turn off Bluetooth → Force-close the app → Re-enable Bluetooth → Remove the Ring from paired devices → Re-pair it via the Ultrahuman app.</li>
                        <li>Try a Different Cable or Adapter: Faulty USB-C cables or power adapters can disrupt charging and connectivity. Switch both the cable and the power source (preferably a wall socket-based adapter).</li>
                        <li>Reinstall the Ultrahuman App: Uninstall and reinstall the app from the App Store to fix persistent issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Step 2:</p>
                    <p>Macro Name: #ConnectionTS2</p>
                    <p>As a last resort, we'll perform a Battery Drain Reset. This step ensures the ring undergoes a complete hardware reset, clearing its internal state and helping resolve issues related to Bluetooth connectivity or advertising.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We have triggered the battery drain reset for you. You should now see a banner with a timer on the Ring tab of your app. This timer estimates the time it will take for the battery to fully drain. Note: If you don't see the banner, try killing and relaunching the app.</li>
                        <li>Please do not place the Ring on the charger until the battery is completely drained, or it will interrupt the reset process.</li>
                        <li>Once the battery is fully drained, you'll receive a push notification prompting you to reconnect. Please charge the ring for at least 30 minutes before you reattempt connecting the ring.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If the ring still does not connect after completing this step, please let us know, and we will assist you further.</p>
                    <p>Step 3: Replace if the above steps don't work, we replace</p>
                    <p>Connection is replacement: The ring is advertising but not connecting to the app</p>
                    <p>Not advertising replacement: The ring is not advertising on the Bluetooth settings</p>
                    <p>If a customer is already frustrated with troubleshooting steps and is not on the latest firmware, please do not ask them to update it.If the customer has already tried the TSW and is clearly irritated:</p>

                    <h3>Incorrect Movement Index</h3>
                    <h4>Case Identifier</h4>
                    <p>Discrepancy in the step count: The ring is either underreporting or overreporting the step count, or there is a discrepancy when comparing the step counts across different wearables.</p>

                    <h4>Resolution</h4>
                    <p>Step 1: Ring fit check</p>
                    <p>Check the fit of the ring and the firmware version→ upgrade to the latest version + push a soft reset</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Could you please confirm the below details:</li>
                        <li>1. Can you confirm how the ring fits you? The ring can be worn on the index, middle, or ring finger and should fit snugly (not too tight or too loose). To remove the ring, push from the bottom and slide it off. For accurate readings, ensure the sensors, marked by a small bulge on the inner side of the ring emitting green lights, are facing the inner side of your palm. Please refer to the attached image for clarification.</li>
                        <li>2. Could you share a close-up image of the sensors on the ring? This would be the area with the small bump on the inner side of the ring.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Step 2: Ring Firmware Check</p>
                    <p>We check the firmware version and upgrade to the relevant version</p>
                    <p>Macro [#Pushto_Zephyr]</p>
                    <p>I have pushed the latest firmware to your ring. Please quit the app completely, and reopen the app in a while. If you don't see the Firmware Update pop-up, it should appear within the next few hours (If it doesn't, please head to ring battery view > scroll down > "check for firmware update"). Once it does, follow the prompts and update your firmware. Once your firmware has been updated, please observe for a while. You shouldn't face these issues anymore :)</p>
                    <p>Let us know how this goes or if you need any help!</p>
                    <p>STEP 3: If the user is on the latest firmware, check the scale of discrepancy by asking for the relevant data points (in case of comparison against any other wearable) and communicate the users the</p>
                    <p>OMS Actions</p>
                    <p>Ring steps 0</p>
                    <p>This is solved by the wizard flow here:</p>
                    <p>Step data incorrect</p>
                    <p>Check with the user if they are comparing this with another wearable</p>
                    <p>If the wearable vs the ring's step count is under 10%, we can inform the user that each wearable tracks steps data according to their own algorithm and hence, 10% diffrence is within the margin of error</p>
                    <p>In case the step count is way off, check for fit and update firmware + soft reset on backend</p>
                    <p>In case the step count does not improve, flag this to tech</p>

                    <h4>Resolution</h4>
                    <p>STEP 1: Ring fit Check</p>
                    <p>We check the Fit of the ring to ensure that the sensors are oriented properly</p>

                    <p>STEP 2: Ring Firmware Check</p>
                    <p>We check the firmware version and upgrade to the relevant version + push a soft reset</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Ring did not capture data: We do this, by going to : Ring data → Sleep indices and pull the data for the same day. We are looking for a non "-1" reading as that indicates no sleep data captured. If the sleep data was not captured, check the ring's battery. If you see that the ring's battery is close to zero, we can inform the user here that the ring can only capture data as long as it has charge. Since the ring died before the data got synced with the phone, the sleep data was lost. We can then inform the user to ensure the ring has sufficient charge regularly. In case the user's battery did not have any issues, check the ring state data to see for any abnormalities. Normally, the ring should show ≥50 which indicates that the data is getting collected. If ring state is also looking normal, check if the record indice count went to 0. This indicates a firmware crash which can also wipe the data. If yes, for any of the above conditions, we can ask the user to update the firmware and perform a soft reset as well.</li>
                        <li>Ring data captured is incorrect: Ring data → Sleep diagnosis → Enter the user's detail for the day and check the sleep start and end times. Look for high amount of motion. Check with the user if they had a disturbed night of sleep or if the ring fits the user well. If not, push the ask the user to update the firmware and perform a soft reset as well. In case the sleep data does not improve, flag this to tech</li>

                    <h3>Menstrual Cycle: Basics</h3>
                    <p>A menstrual cycle is measured from the first day of your period to the day before your next period.</p>
                    <p>The average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days, but everyone's cycle is different. For example, teenagers might have cycles that last 45 days, whereas people in their 20s to 30s might have cycles that last 21 to 38 days.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: Cycle length and period length are 2 different things.</p>
                    <p>The menstrual cycle has 4 phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Menstrual Phase: This is when women have a period. The uterus lining sheds and flows out of the vagina. The period contains blood, mucus and some cells from the lining of the uterus. The average length of a period is 3 to 7 days.</li>
                        <li>Follicular phase: This phase starts on the first day of the period and lasts for 13 to 14 days. Changing hormone levels cause the lining of the uterus to thicken and follicles to grow on the surface of the ovaries. Usually only one follicle will mature into an egg.</li>
                        <li>Ovulation phase: This is when a mature egg is released from an ovary. This usually happens once a month, about 2 weeks before the next period. This is also the time when the chances of getting pregnant are the highest.</li>
                        <li>Luteal phase: In this phase, the egg travels through the fallopian tubes to the uterus. The uterus lining continues to thicken in preparation for pregnancy. In case one gets pregnant, they won't have a period, otherwise they will have a period and the menstrual cycle will start over again. (14 days)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Cycle tracking: Tracking for basic cycle health</h3>
                    <h4>Input parameters:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>period_ranges: A list of period ranges, each containing: Start date of a period, End date of the same period</li>
                        <li>last_cycle_length: Integer representing the length of the most recent cycle (for irregular cycles)</li>
                        <li>typical_cycle_length: Integer representing the typical cycle length (for regular cycles)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>How algo works:</h4>
                    <p>Take last cycle_start_date > Add typical_cycle_length (for regular cycles) or last_cycle_length (for irregular cycles) to it > You get predicted_cycle_start_date of the next cycle > Take difference of last cycle_end_date and cycle_start_date to get cycle duration > Add to predicted_cycle_start_date to get predicted_cycle_end_date</p>
                    <p>NOTE: Current algo assumes future cycles will resemble past cycles and doesn't account for external factors that might affect the cycles (like stress, medication, health conditions, etc)</p>
                    <h4>At any given time, the user would have to be in one of the 6 states:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Menstrual phase: When the user is in their logged menstrual stage (banner shows period start and calculated end dates)</li>
                        <li>Follicular phase: The phase between menstrual and ovulation phases (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Ovulation phase: When the user is in their ovulation phase (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Luteal phase: Phase between ovulation and predicted menstrual phase dates (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Predicted menstrual phase: Menstrual dates predicted by the algo (banner shows the current predicted dates)</li>
                        <li>Unconfirmed phase: If user hasn't logged their periods even after 7 days have passed past the predicted menstrual phase dates (no banner shown)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>NOTE: At the moment there's a bug in the algo whereby the user's max cycle length gets capped to 30 days once they start using the PP. This isn't an issue for the regular cyclers but for irregular ones, this can result in app showing unconfirmed phase until they log in their next cycle dates.</p>
                    <h4>The powerplug remains 'in calibration' mode until the following criterias are met:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>At least 3 cycle start dates</li>
                        <li>At least 50% biomarker data for those cycles</li>
                        <li>BMI ≤28, age is ≤ 40</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Tracking to get pregnant</h3>
                    <h4>Definitions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fertile window: 5 days before ovulation day, ovulation day and one day after ovulation day. So, 7 days in total.</li>
                        <li>Outside fertile window: Any day that's outside the above defined fertile window duration.</li>
                        <li>Approaching fertile window: The day after the period ends up until the start of the fertile window.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>How algo works:</h4>
                    <p>Divided into 3 phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Phase 1: From start of menses upto <40% of cycle duration. Uses past data (cycle start date+biomarkers) to predict fertile window</li>
                        <li>Phase 2: Fertile window (>40% to 70% of cycle duration+5 days) Biomarker algo kicks in and predicts new fertile window (only if enough biomarker data is present)</li>
                        <li>Phase 3: From 5 days past 70% of cycle duration up until the next period start date Uses past data to calculate next fertile window</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The predicted ovulation window is determined by anchoring to your period start date and detecting a biosignature pattern from your temperature, resting heart rate (RHR), and heart rate variability (HRV). As the cycle advances, additional data improves the algorithm's accuracy in detecting the biosignature. This can sometimes shift the predicted ovulation window, especially because we're forecasting the window in real-time, during the cycle itself.</p>
                    <p>NOTE (1): Even 1 day of inaccurate data can affect C&O forecasts. However, we use a 3 day rolling window for data prediction, hence, the user will start seeing major shifts in their fertile window predictions if the data remains inaccurate for 3 days continuously.</p>
                    <p>NOTE(2): The temperature deviation shown in the powerplug tile is different from the skin temperature deviation captured on the home page of the app. This is because we use a 30 day rolling baseline for the calculation of temp deviation for C&O powerplug.</p>

                    <h3>Women's Health Dashboard</h3>
                    <h4>Cycle Tracking Configs Dashboard:</h4>
                    <p>This dashboard gives all the details filled by the user while onboarding into their Cycle & Ovulation Powerplug</p>
                    <h4>Menstrual Cycles Dashboard:</h4>
                    <p>This dashboard shows all of the cycles and their data tracked by the user along with the predicted cycle dates computed by our algorithm.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: We use this dashboard only to check cycle data and other onboarding details filled by the user. This is intended to give a complete overview of the data being shown to the user on their app.</p>

                    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                    <p>NOTE: To troubleshoot any technical issue with the user's powerplug, updating their ring's firmware, resets or making them re-onboard the powerplug is not going to help. We would have to flag it to the tech team.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User feels their ovulation dates predicted by the app aren't correct: Troubleshooting: Currently its not possible to input/log/correct ovulation day that is predicted by the system. But this is an enhancement planned in the next version for April.</li>
                        <li>Users complain that their predicted period days aren't correct: Troubleshooting: They can always "log" their period by tapping the calendar icon on the top right next to the edit cycle details button and we'll revise that to recalculate their phases.</li>
                        <li>The user feels there are days where their temperature has not been recorded (in cycle tracking): When deviation from the recorded baseline is very close to 0, there are no bars shown on the graph. We're working on improvements to the feature so that this is clear going forward. (Currently may also show as "- -" on a given day, on the app)</li>
                        <li>Users complain that they are seeing the 'in calibration' banner even after logging in past 3 cycles data and wearing the ring continuously: Troubleshooting: We show the "In calibration" if we can't come up with a fertility high confidence. This high confidence is decided on some factors as described.</li>
                        <li>User notices that predicted ovulation window changes on a given day: We predict the ovulation window for a user based on 3 biomarkers (temperature deviation, RHR and HRV) - hence, if on any day we find that these biomarkers are more (or less) suggestive towards a certain day, the algorithm will change basis the stronger suggestive biomarker pattern. Hence, the predicted ovulation window may dynamically change.</li>
                        <li>Users complain that the temperature being shown in their sleep index section and the one being shown inside the powerplug are different: Troubleshooting: For the temperature you see on the Sleep Index details page, we calculate it by excluding nap sleep. This gives you an average skin temperature during your main sleep period, without naps affecting the value. However, the skin temperature in the Cycle Tracking details page is pulled from your baseline temperature, which includes all temp data within sleep boundaries—naps included. Hence, the difference.</li>

                        <li>Non-bleeding users: "Amenorrhea," or the absence of menstruation, can be normal during certain periods like before puberty, during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or after menopause, but can also be a sign of various medical conditions or lifestyle factors.</li>
                        <li>SPOTTING: Spotting refers to light vaginal bleeding that occurs outside of your regular menstrual period. Spotting can have various causes, including hormonal fluctuations, ovulation, birth control methods, pregnancy (implantation bleeding), or even certain medical conditions. Spotting is lighter and less prolonged than a regular period, and it usually doesn't require the use of pads or tampons.</li>
