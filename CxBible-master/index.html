                    <li>Request an urgent investigation with the phlebotomy vendor.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>4. Prioritize Reschedule: Work with Vital/the user to reschedule the appointment at the user&#x27;s earliest convenience (aim for within 24-48 hours) at free of cost.</p>
                    <p>5. Consider Service Recovery: Offer an apology credit (policy TBD by Blood Vision) for the significant inconvenience.</p>

                    <li>Minor Delay (e.g., 10-15 minutes): Acknowledge it, apologize. Usually within reasonable limits for traffic/prior appointments.</li>
                    <li>Significant Delay (e.g., 1 hour+): This warrants a more significant service recovery. 4. Service Recovery (for significant delay)</li>
                    <li>Offer to reschedule at no cost if the user prefers not to wait or if the delay is excessive.</li>
                    <li>If a mobile draw fee was charged, consider waiving/refunding it (policy TBD). ● Escalate to Vital to understand the cause and prevent recurrence.</li>

                    <li>For Walk ins the patient can cancel up to any point before their blood is drawn. Vital doesn’t refund the customer, that is up to us! If we cancel the order within Junction we are not charged the per order fee</li>
                    <li>Missed Appointment (First Time): Typically allow one missed appointment without penalty. Help them promptly reschedule. Stress the importance of attending the next one. (Fee waiver for first-time courtesy - TBD).</li>
                    <li>Repeated Missed Appointments/No-Shows: May need to charge the full appointment fee to cover phlebotomist costs.</li>

                    <p>3. Internal Handling (for missed appointments): Ops team may need to issue a new lab requisition if the original was marked as a no-show. Ensure the user&#x27;s testing window (before 12-month expiration) remains open. Follow up with unresponsive users.</p>
                    <p>4. User Anxiety/Fear of Pain (Pre-Test)</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Action</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Empathize &amp; Reassure: Acknowledge their feelings. Reassure them that phlebotomists are highly skilled and perform draws all day. Explaining the process is usually quick with only a slight pinch.</p>
                    <h5>2. Provide Preparation Tips</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Suggest good hydration the day before and morning of the test (water only if fasting) as it makes veins easier to access.</li>
                    <li>Recommend getting a good night&#x27;s sleep and trying to arrive at the appointment relaxed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>3. Advise Communication with Phlebotomists: Encourage the user to inform the phlebotomist about their anxiety upon arrival.</p>
                    <p>4. Option to Lie Down: Inform them they can request to lie down during the draw, which labs/phlebotomists will usually accommodate to prevent fainting.</p>
                    <p>5. Offer Resources: If appropriate, mention that info sheets on coping with needle anxiety can be provided (if developed).</p>
                    <p>6. Document: Note the user&#x27;s anxiety in their record if they consent, so future phlebotomists can be aware if possible.</p>
                    <p>5. User Medical Concerns (Pre-Test, e.g., &quot;Is this test right for me with X condition?&quot;)</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Action</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Clarify Blood Vision&#x27;s Role: Politely reinforce that Blood Vision is a wellness service, not a medical provider. We do not diagnose or treat conditions and cannot give medical advice.</p>
                    <p>2. Advise Physician Consultation: Strongly encourage the user to consult their personal physician for any specific medical concerns or to determine if the test is appropriate for their individual health situation.</p>
                    <p>3. Provide Test Information: Explain what the ordered Blood Vision panel covers and (if asked) what it doesn&#x27;t. Do not over-promise on what the test can detect.</p>
                    <p>4. Do Not Interpret: Avoid interpreting how their specific medical condition might interact with the test or results.</p>
                    <p>5. Refer to Terms of Service: Gently remind them that our terms of service outline our role as an informational service.</p>
                    <h4>During Test Scenarios</h4>
                    <p>1. Excessive Bleeding (Extreme)</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Phlebotomist On-Site (In-Lab or Mobile)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Phlebotomist Action: Trained to apply first aid (direct pressure). For severe, uncontrolled bleeding, they will call 911. They will notify their dispatcher/Blood Vision.</p>
                    <p>2. Blood Vision Support (If contacted during event): Instruct the user/caller to ensure 911 is called immediately. Discontinue non-essential conversation to avoid delaying emergency response.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>User Reports After Event</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Immediate Action: Check on the user&#x27;s well-being. Confirm they received appropriate medical care.</p>
                    <p>2. Document Thoroughly: Record the incident in detail.</p>
                    <p>3. Escalate Internally: Notify medical director and operations lead for liability and follow-up.</p>
                    <p>4. Follow-Up: Coordinate any necessary follow-up, such as rescheduling a new draw if the first was incomplete, once the user is medically cleared.</p>
                    <p>2. Anxiety Response (e.g., Fainting, Dizziness)</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Phlebotomist On-Site</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Phlebotomist Action: Trained to handle vasovagal episodes (e.g., reclining the patient, offering water/juice, ensuring safety). Will call 911 if the situation is serious or doesn&#x27;t resolve.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>User Reports to Support (During or After)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. If Still at Lab/With Phlebo: Instruct them to inform lab staff/phlebotomist immediately. 2. If After Leaving:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Express Concern: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry you had that experience. How are you feeling now?&quot; Ensure they are okay.</li>
                    <li>Immediate Advice: If still unwell, advise them to sit/lie down, drink water. If very dizzy, advise not to drive.</li>
                    <li>Medical Check: If they hit their head or symptoms are severe/persistent, encourage a medical check-up.</li>
                    <li>Reassurance: Explain fainting can happen, especially if fasting, and is not uncommon.</li>
                    <li>Future Draws: Advise them to mention this history at future appointments so they can lie down during the draw as a preventative measure.</li>
                    <li>Document: Record the incident. Flag account for future phlebotomists to use supine position if possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>3. Multiple Pricks Needed to Get Blood (User is &quot;Pincushion&quot;) ● Action</h5>
                    <p>1. Empathize &amp; Apologize: Acknowledge the discomfort and frustration. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry that happened, it sounds very uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
                    <h5>2. If Blood Was Drawn Successfully</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Focus on the positive: &quot;I&#x27;m glad they were able to get the sample eventually.&quot; ● Encourage prep tips for next time: hydration, warm clothes to keep veins dilated. ● If bruising occurs, advise using a cold pack for the first 24 hours, then warm compresses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>3. If Blood Was NOT Drawn / User Lost Confidence</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Offer a reschedule with a different phlebotomist or at a different lab location. ● Offer to try and assign a more experienced mobile phlebotomist if possible. ● Reassure them it&#x27;s not their &quot;fault&quot; – some veins are trickier.</li>
                    <li>Document the difficult draw in their file for future reference.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>4. Internal Review: Note if a particular lab location frequently has issues with difficult draws (via complaint patterns) to guide future lab recommendations.</p>
                    <p>4. Uncooperative User or Phlebotomist</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>If Phlebotomist is Rude/Unprofessional</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Empathize: &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry you had a bad experience; that&#x27;s not what we want for our users.&quot;</p>
                    <p>2. Gather Details: Location, date/time, specific nature of the unprofessional conduct.</p>
                    <p>3. Reassure Action: Inform the user that Blood Vision will follow up with the lab management/phlebotomy service (via Vital).</p>
                    <p>4. Offer Alternatives: Suggest trying a different location for future draws if they are open to it.</p>
                    <p>5. Service Recovery (for egregious incidents): Consider offering a free at-home draw next time or an account credit (pending supervisor approval).</p>
                    <p>6. Internal Escalation: Log the complaint in the quality tracker to Vital. Multiple complaints about a site/person will be escalated for corrective action.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>If User is Uncooperative/Abusive (Phlebotomist reports or support observes)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Phlebotomist Discretion: Phlebotomists have the right to refuse service if their safety is threatened or if the user is overly disruptive, preventing a safe draw.</p>
                    <h5>2. Support Action</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Maintain professionalism.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to de-escalate if the interaction is with support.</li>
                    <li>Document the incident thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>If behavior is egregious, management may need to decide on future service eligibility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Post-Test Scenarios</h4>
                    <p>1. Bruising at Draw Site</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Action</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Acknowledge &amp; Normalize: Explain that bruising can sometimes occur after a blood draw if a vein leaks a little.</p>
                    <p>2. Gather Information: Ask if it&#x27;s just discoloration or if there&#x27;s significant swelling or a hard lump.</p>
                    <h5>3. Provide Care Advice</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Simple Bruise: Suggest applying warm compresses after the first 24 hours; it should fade.</li>
                    <li>Significant Swelling/Pain (possible hematoma): Advise applying a cold pack for the first 24 hours, then switch to warm compresses. This typically resolves on its own.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>4. When to Seek Medical Advice: If pain is severe, swelling is very large or spreading, or if they have concerns, encourage them to see their doctor.</p>
                    <p>2. Continued Pain at Draw Site</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Action</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Empathize &amp; Gather Details: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to hear you&#x27;re still having pain. Can you describe it?&quot;</p>
                    <h5>2. Assess Severity</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Mild Soreness: This can be normal for a day or two. Advise rest for the arm. ● Significant/Persistent Pain: Encourage medical evaluation to rule out any complications.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>3. Check for Infection Signs (Rare): Ask if there&#x27;s redness, warmth, significant swelling, or discharge at the site. If yes, strongly advise seeing a doctor immediately as these could be signs of infection.</p>
                    <p>4. Document: Record the user&#x27;s report.</p>
                    <p>3. Secondary Bleeding (After Leaving Lab/Phlebotomist)</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Action</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>1. Advise Immediate Action</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Instruct the user to apply firm, direct pressure to the site with a clean cloth or bandage for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Suggest elevating the arm if possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>2. When to Seek Medical Attention: If bleeding is significant (soaking through bandages quickly) or doesn&#x27;t stop after applying pressure, advise them to seek medical attention promptly.</p>
                    <p>3. Review Post-Draw Care: Remind them of standard advice (keep bandage on for 30-60 mins, avoid heavy lifting).</p>
                    <p>4. Report Delays / Missing Reports</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Expected Turnaround: Standard panels ~5-10 business days;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>comprehensive/specialized tests possibly 2+ weeks. Users are notified by email/app when ready.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Action (If results are beyond the expected window and not received): 1. Apologize for Delay: Acknowledge their anticipation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>2. Internal Check (Step 1): Support checks internally (via Vital access to lab interface using the the request/partner token) to see if results have been received from the lab but not pushed to the user&#x27;s account (potential IT issue).</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>If results are in the lab interface: Escalate to our tech team to import them. Consider manually providing results to the user in the interim if feasible and secure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Example</h5>
                    <p>3. Lab Check (Step 2 - If not in interface): Contact the lab (via Vital) by flagging them on #junction-x-ultrahuman-cs to investigate the status. The test might be delayed or require a re-run. Obtain an ETA from the lab.</p>
                    <h5>Example from Junction Dash</h5>
                    <p>Example flagged thread: here</p>
                    <h5>4. Communicate with User</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Provide an honest update. If the cause is known (e.g., &quot;One of your test markers needed a confirmatory run, so it&#x27;s taking a bit longer&quot;), explain it.</li>
                    <li>Give a new estimated date for results.</li>
                    <li>Reassure them Blood Vision is actively monitoring it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>5. If Sample Lost/Lab Error (True Failure): Arrange a redraw quickly at no cost to the user. Prioritize their next appointment.</p>
                    <p>5. Refund-Related Concerns</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>General Policy Recap</li>
                    <li>Cancellation &gt;24h before draw, within 24h of purchase: Full refund. ● Cancellation &gt;24h before draw, after 24h of purchase (up to 60 days): Full refund</li>
                    <li>No show at lab or at-home: 1st time waiver (no-fee), next time charge $50 administrative fee</li>
                    <li>After Blood Has Been Drawn: No refund (service rendered).</li>
                    <li>Unhappy with Results/Changed Mind: Generally no refund. Offer to clarify results, perhaps a discount on a future test if value is the concern.</li>
                    <li>Memberships (if any): Not refundable once started; no proration for unused months/tests.</li>
                    <li>Action</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1. Empathize: Understand the user&#x27;s concern.</p>
                    <p>2. Clarify Policy: Gently explain the applicable refund policy based on their specific situation (timing of cancellation, sample status). Refer to Terms of Service.</p>
                    <p>3. Address Misrepresentation Claims: If a user claims the service was misrepresented (e.g., &quot;thought a doctor consult was included&quot;), explain the misunderstanding. As a one-time exception, consider arranging a call with a clinician (unofficial, case-by-case). A refund is still not standard.</p>
                    <h5>4. Service Failures (Grounds for Free Re-test/Recollection)</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Sample unusable/results inconclusive due to lab error (hemolyzed, delayed sample). ● Phlebotomist failed to collect enough sample/kit compromised.</li>
                    <li>User paid out-of-pocket due to Blood Vision error.</li>
                    <li>Strong dispute of result accuracy (one courtesy re-test of a specific marker, once per user/issue ideally).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>5. Exceptional Refunds (for service failure where user doesn&#x27;t want redraw): Case-by-case basis, requires supervisor approval (policy TBD for amount). Empower support leads for this.</p>
                    <p>6. Document: Thoroughly document all refund discussions and decisions.</p>
                    <p>Refunds should ideally be processed as Manual refunds. However, if the user is too very irate and wants it to the source payment made, then we can make an exception and process a stripe refund (subject to approval by lead)</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Can we set up a phone line for customer support?</li>
                    <li>We do not have a phone line for direct customer support. We suggest you communicate with Junction through slack for any inquiries you need help with. Our lab account phone number appears on the requisition and if a patient were to call that number, our team will respond on your behalf but this is not used as a customer support line specifically.</li>

                    <h3>Ultrahuman M1 Overview</h3>
                    <p>The Ultrahuman M1 is a wearable glucose monitoring system designed to help users optimize their metabolic health. It works by continuously measuring glucose levels from the interstitial fluid using a CGM sensor.</p>

                    <h4>How It Works</h4>
                    <p>The device uses a tiny filament inserted just under the skin (painlessly, for most people). It tracks your glucose levels 24/7, updating every few minutes. You scan the sensor with your phone to retrieve the data.</p>

                    <p>sensor_scan_not_working Sensor Sensor fails to successfully scan and enter the 60 min warm up stage This is a possible NFC not working situation. Three troubleshooting techniques we go for - a) Restarting the phone b) Uninstalling and reinstalling the app c) Logging out and logging in If the user is on an iPhone, simply asking them the iPhone works. If the NFC issue persists, request the user to check with family/friends for an NFC enabled phone. The start once they successfully activate their sensor worries there. Also, the sensor stores data for if there's anyone's phone that they could use once every 7 hours, that would do it. The user be logged in from multiple devices using the same details, so they can monitor from their phone make all the necessary inputs and just use the friends/family phone for scanning. Some quirky pointers - If the user is using a Samsung phone, ask them to off their case and use the back side of their phone scan the sensor. Sometimes the case's thickness the NFC from working properly. There seems to be some problem with OnePlus phone's NFC. Just confirm the phone model or proceeding with troubleshooting problems.</p>
                    <p>sensor_invalid_readings Sensor Sensor is reporting invalid readings (≤40 or ≥500) for over 6-8 hours. Readings less than 40 and higher than 500 considered invalid readings. Check this data on Stints place of the Ops Dash. If invalid readings persist for over 6 hours, replace. If the user is in the first 24 hours, we ask them for the first 24 hour window.</p>
                    <p>sensor_invalid_reading_midway Sensor Cyborgs graph isn't updating upon scanning/stuck at the same value Check 'CGM Stints/Lifetime Data' on the ops dashboard. Look for readings below 40 or above If it's Day 1 on the sensor, let the user know sensor takes 24 hours to calibrate. If it's past Day 1 and the sensor has been replaced invalid readings for over 6-8 hours, process a replacement.</p>

                    <h3>Menstrual Cycle: Basics</h3>
                    <p>A menstrual cycle is measured from the first day of your period to the day before your next period.</p>
                    <p>The average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days, but everyone's cycle is different. For example, teenagers might have cycles that last 45 days, whereas people in their 20s to 30s might have cycles that last 21 to 38 days.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: Cycle length and period length are 2 different things.</p>
                    <p>The menstrual cycle has 4 phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Menstrual Phase: This is when women have a period. The uterus lining sheds and flows out of the vagina. The period contains blood, mucus and some cells from the lining of the uterus. The average length of a period is 3 to 7 days.</li>
                        <li>Follicular phase: This phase starts on the first day of the period and lasts for 13 to 14 days. Changing hormone levels cause the lining of the uterus to thicken and follicles to grow on the surface of the ovaries. Usually only one follicle will mature into an egg.</li>
                        <li>Ovulation phase: This is when a mature egg is released from an ovary. This usually happens once a month, about 2 weeks before the next period. This is also the time when the chances of getting pregnant are the highest.</li>
                        <li>Luteal phase: In this phase, the egg travels through the fallopian tubes to the uterus. The uterus lining continues to thicken in preparation for pregnancy. In case one gets pregnant, they won't have a period, otherwise they will have a period and the menstrual cycle will start over again. (14 days)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>App Onboarding</h3>
                    <p>Users are prompted to integrate and import their cycle data from a third party app (if any), input their primary goal for using this powerplug, period length, cycle regularity, cycle length, period dates, health conditions (if any) and any birth control used in the last 6 months.</p>

                    <h3>Integrations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We only import period start and end dates from the integrated apps.</li>
                        <li>As soon as the user integrates the two apps, the data should sync immediately.</li>
                        <li>For the users facing issues logging in their Clue app, flag the cases to Terra on this thread.</li>
                        <li>Once the cycle data has been imported into UH from the integrated apps, further changes to the data on the third party app won't change the data in UH. Also, any changes made to the data by the user on UH won't be written back to the integrated app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Cycle tracking: Tracking for basic cycle health</h3>
                    <h4>Input parameters:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>period_ranges: A list of period ranges, each containing: Start date of a period, End date of the same period</li>
                        <li>last_cycle_length: Integer representing the length of the most recent cycle (for irregular cycles)</li>
                        <li>typical_cycle_length: Integer representing the typical cycle length (for regular cycles)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>How algo works:</h4>
                    <p>Take last cycle_start_date > Add typical_cycle_length (for regular cycles) or last_cycle_length (for irregular cycles) to it > You get predicted_cycle_start_date of the next cycle > Take difference of last cycle_end_date and cycle_start_date to get cycle duration > Add to predicted_cycle_start_date to get predicted_cycle_end_date</p>
                    <p>NOTE: Current algo assumes future cycles will resemble past cycles and doesn't account for external factors that might affect the cycles (like stress, medication, health conditions, etc)</p>
                    <h4>At any given time, the user would have to be in one of the 6 states:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Menstrual phase: When the user is in their logged menstrual stage (banner shows period start and calculated end dates)</li>
                        <li>Follicular phase: The phase between menstrual and ovulation phases (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Ovulation phase: When the user is in their ovulation phase (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Luteal phase: Phase between ovulation and predicted menstrual phase dates (banner shows next predicted period dates)</li>
                        <li>Predicted menstrual phase: Menstrual dates predicted by the algo (banner shows the current predicted dates)</li>
                        <li>Unconfirmed phase: If user hasn't logged their periods even after 7 days have passed past the predicted menstrual phase dates (no banner shown)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>NOTE: At the moment there's a bug in the algo whereby the user's max cycle length gets capped to 30 days once they start using the PP. This isn't an issue for the regular cyclers but for irregular ones, this can result in app showing unconfirmed phase until they log in their next cycle dates.</p>
                    <h4>The powerplug remains 'in calibration' mode until the following criterias are met:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>At least 3 cycle start dates</li>
                        <li>At least 50% biomarker data for those cycles</li>
                        <li>BMI ≤28, age is ≤ 40</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Tracking to get pregnant</h3>
                    <h4>Definitions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fertile window: 5 days before ovulation day, ovulation day and one day after ovulation day. So, 7 days in total.</li>
                        <li>Outside fertile window: Any day that's outside the above defined fertile window duration.</li>
                        <li>Approaching fertile window: The day after the period ends up until the start of the fertile window.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>How algo works:</h4>
                    <p>Divided into 3 phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Phase 1: From start of menses upto <40% of cycle duration. Uses past data (cycle start date+biomarkers) to predict fertile window</li>
                        <li>Phase 2: Fertile window (>40% to 70% of cycle duration+5 days) Biomarker algo kicks in and predicts new fertile window (only if enough biomarker data is present)</li>
                        <li>Phase 3: From 5 days past 70% of cycle duration up until the next period start date Uses past data to calculate next fertile window</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The predicted ovulation window is determined by anchoring to your period start date and detecting a biosignature pattern from your temperature, resting heart rate (RHR), and heart rate variability (HRV). As the cycle advances, additional data improves the algorithm's accuracy in detecting the biosignature. This can sometimes shift the predicted ovulation window, especially because we're forecasting the window in real-time, during the cycle itself.</p>
                    <p>NOTE (1): Even 1 day of inaccurate data can affect C&O forecasts. However, we use a 3 day rolling window for data prediction, hence, the user will start seeing major shifts in their fertile window predictions if the data remains inaccurate for 3 days continuously.</p>
                    <p>NOTE(2): The temperature deviation shown in the powerplug tile is different from the skin temperature deviation captured on the home page of the app. This is because we use a 30 day rolling baseline for the calculation of temp deviation for C&O powerplug.</p>

                    <h4>Cycle Tracking Configs Dashboard:</h4>
                    <p>This dashboard gives all the details filled by the user while onboarding into their Cycle & Ovulation Powerplug</p>
                    <h4>Menstrual Cycles Dashboard:</h4>
                    <p>This dashboard shows all of the cycles and their data tracked by the user along with the predicted cycle dates computed by our algorithm.</p>
                    <p>NOTE: We use this dashboard only to check cycle data and other onboarding details filled by the user. This is intended to give a complete overview of the data being shown to the user on their app.</p>

                    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
                    <p>NOTE: To troubleshoot any technical issue with the user's powerplug, updating their ring's firmware, resets or making them re-onboard the powerplug is not going to help. We would have to flag it to the tech team.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User feels their ovulation dates predicted by the app aren't correct: Troubleshooting: Currently its not possible to input/log/correct ovulation day that is predicted by the system. But this is an enhancement planned in the next version for April.</li>
                        <li>Users complain that their predicted period days aren't correct: Troubleshooting: They can always "log" their period by tapping the calendar icon on the top right next to the edit cycle details button and we'll revise that to recalculate their phases.</li>
                        <li>The user feels there are days where their temperature has not been recorded (in cycle tracking): When deviation from the recorded baseline is very close to 0, there are no bars shown on the graph. We're working on improvements to the feature so that this is clear going forward. (Currently may also show as "- -" on a given day, on the app)</li>
                        <li>Users complain that they are seeing the 'in calibration' banner even after logging in past 3 cycles data and wearing the ring continuously: Troubleshooting: We show the "In calibration" if we can't come up with a fertility high confidence. This high confidence is decided on some factors as described.</li>
                        <li>User notices that predicted ovulation window changes on a given day: We predict the ovulation window for a user based on 3 biomarkers (temperature deviation, RHR and HRV) - hence, if on any day we find that these biomarkers are more (or less) suggestive towards a certain day, the algorithm will change basis the stronger suggestive biomarker pattern. Hence, the predicted ovulation window may dynamically change.</li>
                        <li>Users complain that the temperature being shown in their sleep index section and the one being shown inside the powerplug are different: Troubleshooting: For the temperature you see on the Sleep Index details page, we calculate it by excluding nap sleep. This gives you an average skin temperature during your main sleep period, without naps affecting the value. However, the skin temperature in the Cycle Tracking details page is pulled from your baseline temperature, which includes all temp data within sleep boundaries—naps included. Hence, the difference.</li>

                        <li>Non-bleeding users: "Amenorrhea," or the absence of menstruation, can be normal during certain periods like before puberty, during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or after menopause, but can also be a sign of various medical conditions or lifestyle factors.</li>
                        <li>SPOTTING: Spotting refers to light vaginal bleeding that occurs outside of your regular menstrual period. Spotting can have various causes, including hormonal fluctuations, ovulation, birth control methods, pregnancy (implantation bleeding), or even certain medical conditions. Spotting is lighter and less prolonged than a regular period, and it usually doesn't require the use of pads or tampons.</li>
                        <li>Make provision to input LH result</li>
                        <li>Increase temp data to upto 2 decimal places.</li>

                    <p>Specific improvements we're working on to address some of the issues over the next few weeks:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stabilizing the ovulation window — Once a high-probability ovulation window is identified, we'll prevent multiple shifts later in the same cycle.</li>
                        <li>Marking ovulation day — You'll be able to manually mark your ovulation day to refine predictions and improve future accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Bug fixes for irregular cycles — We're fixing issues that impact predictions for users with irregular cycle lengths.</li>
